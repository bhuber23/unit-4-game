# Crystal Collector Game
This assignment was to create a game in which you would be given a random number, with the objective being that you would need to match that random number after clicking on the "crystals" which have a random value assigned to them.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS 
- jQuery

## Features
- When you first start the game, you will have a random score that you need to match between 19-120.
- Click on each Infinity Stone to increase your score. Each Infinity Stone has a random value, which you do not learn until you've clicked on the stone. The values of the stones can range from 1-12.
- If your score goes over the random number generated, you lose the game and automatically receive a new number to match. 
- If you win, you will also receive a new number to match to keep playing the game.
- The game tracks both your total wins and losses.
